## Streamlit Web App 008 - Penguin Classification

## Web App that predicts the different types of varieties from the classic Iris Dataset.

### Notebooks
Model Creation
Creation of several models with different parameters to test which are the best performing according to specific metrics.

Model Parameter Decision
Choosing specific parameters to use on model creation file.


### Python File 01/02 - Model Creation

- Creation of model with specific hyperparameters.
- Model performance testing with specific metrics.


### Python File 02/02 - Web App Creation

Creation of Web App that performs classification with loaded model that was previously fitted.

The model performs the Classification of different class labels of penguin species using the different set of inputs as features.

Two types of Inputs can be used:

The user can use and modify de features located on the web app.
Input:
    - Island
    - Sex
    - Bill length (mm)
    - Bill depth (mm)
    - Flipper length (mm)
    - Body mass (g)

The user can input a CSV file with the required features so the model can perform the classification task
    - An Example CSV File can be used.

Output:
    - Dataframe showing given inputs
    - Prediction Probabilities of each of the following classes that exist
    - Shown index of predicted class label
    - Prediction name
    - Prediction probability
