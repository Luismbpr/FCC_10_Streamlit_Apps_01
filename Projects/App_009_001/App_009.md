## Streamlit Web App 009 - Regression of Housing Data

## Web App That Performs Regression On California Housing Dataset

### Notebook
Model Creation
Creation of several models with different parameters to test which are the best performing according to specific metrics.


Model Parameter Decision
Choosing specific parameters to use on model creation file.


### Python File 01/02 - Model Creation

- Creation of model with specific hyperparameters.
- Model performance testing with specific metrics.


### Python File 02/02 - Web App Creation

Creation of Web App that performs regression with loaded model that was previously fitted.

The model performs Regression to predict Median House Value using the different set of inputs as features.

The user uses and modifies the features located on the web app.

Note: The input features are for a district and not for a single home.

Input:
    - Ocean Proximity
    - Longitude
    - Latitude
    - Housing median age (On a district)
    - Total rooms (On a district)
    - Total bedrooms (On a district)
    - Population
    - Households
    - Median income

Class Label: Median House Value

Output:
    - Dataframe showing given inputs
    - Prediction of Class Label: Median House Value
    - Class Label Mean (y mean)
    - Class Label Median (y median)

Output With Shapley:
    - Shapley Value Plots
